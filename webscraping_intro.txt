1.Definition of webscraping..

Webscraping (web harvesting or web data extraction):

	is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the http:// or through a web browser.

	The term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a 'bot' or webcrawler. 

	It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.


Webscraping a webpage involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when you view the page.)

Therefore, web crawling is a main component of webscraping, to fetch pages for later processing.

Once fetched, then extraction takes place.
